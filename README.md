# crispy-octo-spork
Mono Repo for a COP maintenance application at Tricon Infotech

# The Why
- As of now, there is a lot of great work happening in the Communities of Practice in Tricon, but most of the efforts are isolated within a single community. This project is an initiative to work collaboratively on a project.
- Lot of tracking and planning for the Communities of Practice is happening through manual processes like maintaining excel sheets and manually sending emails regarding COP events. We can automate this process by creating an application/suite of applications to automate this process
- Lot of people want to dip their toes in other technologies but it can be overwhelming to start from scratch. Mentorship and training can help but nothing beats getting your hands dirty and writing some code (or the equivalent of this for non-development related CoPs). This project can be an opportunity where people can start contributing as tiny chunks in the technologies that they are interested in while looking at the rest of the code for guidance/motivation.

# The What
This is a mono repository for all code and assets related to the application we are building. Each part of the application resides in its folder with a readme file containing the guidelines for contributing.

The features of this application are not yet decided. We can have a wider discussion to identify the major pain points while organizing CoP activities and build those features. Let's keep the feature set small so that we can have something working. More features can always be added later.

# The How
The code commits to this repository are completely voluntary. There is no obligation to contribute. Contribution can also be sharing ideas or suggestions for features. However, we want to keep the production level code quality so that people can use this as a reference.

We would want some people who can be maintainers while the rest of the contribution can be voluntary.

## Why call it crispy-octo-spork though?
> There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.

So we left the burden on GitHub and picked the auto-generated name. Maybe the first contribution could be a suggestion for a name.
